				<h2>What Is It?</h2>
			   <p>This site offers tools to help for-profit law offices calculate and use hourly fees for clients based on sliding-scales. 
			   Although the fees are computed on an hourly basis, it's easy to apply the results to flat-fee situations.</p>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>The site currently offers tools to compute:
							<ul>
							<li>The client's <i>threshold ratio</i>&mdash;a benchmark of the client's economic status.</li>
							<li>A sliding-scale fee, given the client's' threshold ratio.</li>
							<li>Projected revenue, given a fee structure and assumptions about clientele.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>The tools reduce the confusion and hassle associated with computing sliding-scale fees. Benchmarking a client's economic status,
						in particular, can be a pain in the neck without a tool that brings together sources of income, relevant thresholds, and
						inflation adjustment.</li>
						<li>The user must identify the assumptions necessary for a sound fee structure. This makes sliding-scale fees less susceptible 
						to arbitrary decisions, self-serving manipulation, and logical inconsistency.</li>
						<li>The user can <i>document, document, document</i> his or her fee structure and its application to a given
						client. Added to the client's file, the attorney has a clear record of what they charged, how they came up with their numbers,
						and both the underlying assumptions and client "inputs" the attorney used.</li>
						<li>The user can forecast how fee structures impact revenue, given the clientele an office serves.</li>
						<li>Statistics on poverty help the attorney put their fee structure in context.</li>  
					</ul>
					<p>The site has plenty of documentation that explains our approaches to this issue.</p>
				</div>

				<h2>How It Works</h2>
				<div>
					<ol>
						<li>Select Calculate&rarr;Threshold Ratio. Choose a locale (or the U.S. as a whole), housing status, and
						the number of children, adults, and older adults in the family. Enter wages and other income where indicated.
						For most income, you can enter either annual amounts or monthly amounts, and the computer will adjust accordingly.
						Several applicable thresholds and threshold ratios appear at the bottom of the page. These can be interpreted as
						percents. For example, a ratio of 1.12 means that a client is 12% above his or her threshold. A ratio of 0.88 means that
						the client is 88% of his or her threshold, or 12 percentage points below it.</li>
						<li>Select Calculate&rarr;Fee&rarr;Calculator (after reading the instructions, of course). You will choose
						a model for the fee structure. Then you will choose one of the threshold ratios calculated in Step 1. The computer
						will apply the fee structure to that threshold ratio. You can examine a graph or a table of your sliding-scale fee.</li>
						<li>That's pretty much it. You are encouraged to Print your results. Selecting Print will create a printer-friendly
						document that you can print or save as a .pdf and add to the client's file.</li>
						<li>If you want, you can get a rough sense of how your sliding-scale fee structure may impact revenue over time. Select
						Calculate&rarr;Revenue&rarr;Instructions to get started.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<h2>Test Yourself</h2>
				<p>If you're a new to sliding-scale fees or this site or both, then you might want to apply the calculators to the following
				hypotheticals to check whether or not you're on the right track or are missing useful site functionality. These hypotheticals
				raise some of the well-known difficulties in assessing client need.</p>
				<div>
					<ol>
						<li>A family of four in Decatur, AL (one adult and three minor children) earns $10/hour working 35 hours/week.
						The family rents its home. It receives $1,000 a month in child support and $8,000 a year in TANF. The attorney chooses
						a "flexible" fee structure, rounded in units of $1.00. That fee structure has a minimum fee of $25 and a maximum of $320.
						The attorney charges the maximum fee when a client's threshold ratio reaches 2 and the minimum when the client's threshold ratio 
						reaches 0.4. Clients at the threshold receive a 40% discount (the fee is 60% of the maximum fee). The attorney chooses
						shape parameters of 0. Using 100% of the supplemental poverty threshold as the benchmark of family need, what is the 
						attorney's fee?
						</li>
						<li>A family in a small town in rural Idaho owns its home outright. The family is comprised of two adults, one
						age 62 and one age 67. Spouse #1 earns $500 a month during six summer months doing odds and ends. Spouse #2 is self-
						employed and grossly roughly $12,000 last year. They receive $600 a month in regular social security income (SSI) and
						$8,000 a year in pension and IRA distributions. All of the family's income has been going to Spouse #1's health costs.
						The attorney charges a minimum of $80 and a maximum of $280 and rounds fees to units of $10. Using an empirical sliding-scale fee (which is based on
						the family's vulnerability to poverty) based only available income, and using 125% of the supplemental poverty threshold as a benchmark
						of the family's need, what is the fee?
						</li>
						<li>A family of three lives in Portland, Oregon (which is in Multnomah County). The two young adults (29 and 27) have a new baby, 
						are starting a business, paying student tuition, and struggling to pay their home mortgage. Their main income is Spouse #1's
						salary, which is $4,000 a month (12 months a year). (The family is quick to point out that 20% of that went to payroll taxes.)
						Spouse #2 is a student and stay-at-home parent. The family received $133 in federal tax credits last year and $500 in dividends. Spouse 2's
						parents gave them a used car worth $6,000 and $5,000 gift certificate for baby supplies. Complications from the 
						baby's delivery have resulted in hospital bills averaging $500 a month. Spouse #1 has been sued. The mandatory court filing fees
						will total around $1,000, though the case will involve several thousand additional dollars worth of litigation expenses. The attorney
						likes using <a href = "https://www.selfsufficiencystandard.org/">self-sufficiency standards</a> to benchmark family need,
						since they can do a better job than official benchmarks of accounting for important costs and identifying a point above which
						a family is ineligible for government benefits. The attorney charges a minimum of $75 an hour and a maximum of $450 an hour.
						Using an empirical fee structure rounded to $5 increments and based on <b>all</b> sources of income, 
						what is the attorney's fee?</li>

						<li>A 40 year-old woman living in a domestic violence shelter earns $10 an hour working 30 hours a week. She lives in Marysville, WA,
						a town of 65,000 people. Her ex-husband owes her $500 a month in spousal support, but she has never received any. She has
						no assets or other income. She is facing $1,000 of mandatory filing costs in order to sue for a judgment on the spousal support.
						The attorney charges a maximum of $250 an hour, but his overhead is very low and he could pay his essential firm expenses 
						(though not any of his time) if clients paid $10 an hour. He feels most comfortable with a threshold based on 175% of a
						client's official poverty guideline. His fees are rounded to the nearest $10. He offers his minimum fee to anyone 50% of that
						threshold, but anyone 50% over the threshold must pay the maximum. Clients exactly at the threshold pay 40% of the maximum 
						(a discount of 60%). Because he likes a smoother scale, he chooses a "shape" structure where the lower shape is set to "1"
						and the upper shape is set to "2." What is the client's fee? Suppose instead that the minimum wage in Washington were raised to $15. 
						What would the client's fee be?</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Answers</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>The family's official poverty guideline is $24,249 (ratio of 0.75), official poverty threshold is $24,273 (ratio of 0.75)
						, and supplemental threshold is $20,540 (ratio of 0.89). Using that ratio, the fee is $161.00.</li>
						<li>The family's official poverty guideline is $15,930 (ratio of 1.90), official poverty threshold is $15,973 (ratio of 1.89)
						, and supplemental threshold is $12,809 (ratio of 2.36). 125% of the supplemental threshold is 1.89. The fee is $260. 
						(Note that the fact that income was spent on medical expenses does not figure into the calculations.)</li>
						<li>The family's self-sufficiency standard is $57,644 in 2014 dollars, which is $57,152 in June 2015 dollars (yes, there has
						been modest deflation since 2014; it will probably turn into inflation by the end of the year). The attorney excludes $1,000
						of mandatory filing fees from the client's income. This yields income of $47,633 and a threshold
						ratio of 0.83. It is interesting to compare that number is to the official statistics. The client's fee is
						$275. (Using the official guideline, instead, which a government program might do, the fee would be $430.)</li>
						<li>Applying the $1,000 discount on account of the mandatory filing fees, the client's threshold ratio is 0.71 and her
						fee is $35. If the minimum wage were raised to $15/hr, the client's threshold ratio would be 1.99 and her fee would be $250/hr.</li>

				<h1>Frequently (and Some Infrequently) Asked Questions</h1>
				<h3 class = "question" id = "q_1">Given their measurement problems should anyone bother with <i>thresholds</i>?</h3>
				<div class = "answer" id = "ans_1" hidden><li>In order to compare families in terms of their economic status, <i>some</i> objective benchmark of 
				need, available income, or economic vulnerability is required. Otherwise comparisons become hopelessly relativistic.
				Nearly all of us are poor if we use Bill Gates as the benchmark. Thresholds are far from perfect, but they represent
				an objective, population-level criterion of family economic status that anchors comparisons.</li></div>

				<h3 class = "question"  id = "q_2">Why not base a sliding scale on raw family income? It's easier.</h3>
				<div class = "answer" id = "ans_2" hidden><li>Because it doesn't account for family composition and because it doesn't 
				use any objective standard of need. Larger families and families in areas with lower costs of living (such as rural areas) will
				have more favorable fee structures than smaller families or families facing higher costs of living. This is 
				why the census bureau uses threshold ratios and why it has been working hard to improve its poverty measurements.</li></div>
				
				<h3 class = "question"  id = "q_3">Why not instead base the scale on population medians or quantiles (<i>i.e.</i>, the 
				bottom 20% of the family income distribution)? Or averages?</h3>
				<div class = "answer" id = "ans_3" hidden><li>Because this doesn't account for family composition and because it doesn't 
				rely on any objective standard of need. The scale would mostly benefit retirees, rural families, and college students. 
				Now, if you employ empirical income distributions for your area, perhaps using the American Community Survey from census.gov, and
				estimated different distributions for different classes of family composition, you would be doing something closer to
				what threshold ratios accomplish. But threshold ratios offer the additional advantage of permitting comparisons among families
				in with different compositions and in different areas. Income distributions are very skewed; arithmetical averages describe
				 them poorly and should not be used for that purpose.</li></div>

				<h3 class = "question"  id = "q_4">Thresholds sound fine, but threshold <i>ratios</i> seem too complicated. 
				Why not just compute $I - $T, where $I is the family's income and $T is the family's threshold?</h3>
				<div class = "answer" id = "ans_4" hidden><li>Because the value of one additional dollar of income is not the same for 
				different families. For example, a family of one person that is $1,000 over its threshold is better off than a family with
				one adult and three kids that is $1,000 over <i>its</it> threshold.</i></li></div>
				
				<h3 class = "question"  id = "q_5">What about family <i>assets</i>? If my client has no job, no government transfers, no other income, but has $100,000 in the bank,
				why should I give him discount?</h3>
				<div class = "answer" id = "ans_5" hidden><li>You might not want to. The relationship between assets and income is 
				<a href = "https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2012/pdf/scf12.pdf">not straightforward</a> for most Americans. 
				But consider:  Accounting for a client's assets without taking into account the client's <i>liabilities</i>
				puts your thumb on the scale. And accounting for <i>income</i> is hard enough. Is the extra difficulty of estimating net asset value worth it?
				Also, what principles will you use to distinguish liquid from illiquid assets? What if the money is
				in an IRA? A spendthrift trust in the client's name?</li>
				<li>Of course, situations like that posed by this question can and do arise. Some organizations (such
				as Oregon's <a href = "https://www.osbar.org/_docs/public/diy/modestmeansapp.pdf">modest means" program for discounted legal services</a>) do wade into these waters. 
				But they are deep. We, at least, are skeptical that
				sufficient analysis informs most such approaches. Or, at least, we are skeptical that organizations can explain or justify their approach with
				a degree of analytical clarity that demonstrates a solid grasp of the associated measurement issues.</li>
				<li><i>Nevertheless</i>, we think that attorneys would be entirely justified
				in developing and employing a model that <b>does</b> engage the measurement issues and articulate its resolution of them.</li></div>
				
				<h3 class = "question"  id = "q_6">What about pre-tax versus post-tax income? Should I reduce "available" income by taxes paid or increase it
				by tax credits?</h3>
				<div class = "answer" id = "ans_6" hidden><li>Good question. The issue is muddy. A smart answer will deeply engage the mechanics of the specific threshold used.</li>
				<li>When the U.S. government <i>statistically analyzes</i> poverty, tax credits (and government transfers) are included by the 
				supplemental poverty measure and excluded by the official measures. <i>See</i> 
				<a href = "https://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/fastfocus/pdfs/FF14-2012.pdf">David S. Johnson and Timothy M. Smeeding, 2012, "A Consumer's Guide to Interpreting Various U.S. Poverty Measures," Fast Focus No. 14-2012, 
				based on K. Short, The Research Supplemental Poverty Measure: 2011, Current Population Reports, P60-244, November 2012, U.S. Census Bureau</a>. 
				Since the supplemental poverty threshold is based on pre-tax income and includes government transfers, 
				then one could argue that comparing a family to that threshold requires doing likewise.</li>
				<li>On the other hand, the purpose of the sliding-scale fee structure is not to describe a population's well-being. The purpose is to 
				calibrate attorney fees to a client's <b>available income</b> or a client's <b>economic vulnerability</b> by incorporating a threshold that reflects 
				local costs of living. Money spent on payroll and income taxes, in-kind transfers, and sums
				earmarked for specific purposes (<i>i.e.</i>, child support) are not 'available' income in this sense and it seems
				bizarre to include them in the numerator of a threshold ratio, even if they appear in its denominator.</li>
				<li>We hasten to add that a metric like the <a href = "https://www.selfsufficiencystandard.org/">self-sufficiency standard</a> helps somewhat by calculating 
				the amount of (non-transfer, non-earmarked) income a family <i>would need</i> in order to not survive without being eligible for
				 government transfers. Tax payments and credits and
				government transfers are cleanly accounted for. Such a metric does not completely resolve the difficulties&mdash;particularly when
				"economic vulnerability" is the basis of the fee structure, since that model uses an official poverty threshold as a benchmark of
				family need.</li>
				<li>This is, admittedly, distressing. It helps (us at least) to remember that:</li>
				<ol><li>Government programs and nonprofits routinely give or deny families life-altering aid on the basis of chaotic logic, 
				wildly inconsistent	measures of family resources, and thresholds (official poverty guidelines) at best only loosely related a family's
				 economic status.</li>
				<li>A for-profit firm does not need to give any discounts at all.</li>
				<li>Not using a sliding scale at all is, for all intents and purposes, equivalent to using a sliding scale and then grossly overstating
				every client's income to charge all cients the same, maximum fee. So as long as you consistently used the same technique with all clients,
				even a technique with measurement error would be an improvement.</li>
				<li>We're working on it.</li></ol>
				</div>
				
				<h3 class = "question"  id = "q_7">I'll go broke if I use a sliding-scale!</h3>
				<div class = "answer" id = "ans_7" hidden>
				<li>Some attorneys would earn less than they would otherwise. The revenue projections are 
				intended to help identify a sliding-scale fee structure that suits the attorney's income goals. 
				Not all for-profit firms have income maximization
				as their lone goal. And some clients who might not otherwise afford 
				an attorney might instead be able to afford one offering a sliding-scale fee. Those might be additional clients&mdash;not maximum-fee-paying
				clients you lost.</li>
				<li>It is important to distinguish the issue of whether to have a sliding-scale fee structure from the decision to serve a 
				particular client base. Only you know who your clients are. There is no shame in exclusively serving wealthy clients.</li></div>

				<h3 class = "question"  id = "q_8">What about "needy" businesses and nonprofits?</h3>
				<div class = "answer" id = "ans_8" hidden><li>The lynchpin of our sliding-scale approach is "family" income. 
				The logic spelled out here does not
				generalize in a straightforward manner to entities. But this is a very important issue and producing a
				coherent sliding-scale approach for entities is one of our highest priorities.</li>
				</div>

				<h3 class = "question"  id = "q_9">Clients with no available income have zero dollars available for attorneys, filing fees,
				or litigation expenses. How can they be expected to pay <i>anything</i>?</h3>
				<div class = "answer" id = "ans_9" hidden><li>Fair point. Our approach is not a panacea. Lack of access to
				justice is a difficult problem. Our ideas:  Show attorney show to charge less, and improve on the random discounting
				that attorneys often do on the basis of impressionistic data about client need. If you have a better idea that moves
				the conversation beyond the stale access-to-justice paradigms of the 1970s, we'd love to hear it.</li>
				</div>


				<h3 class = "question" id = "q_10">Can I help?</h3>
				<div class = "answer" id = "ans_10" hidden><li>Yes! We need help from researchers, journalists, politicians, lawyers, judges, administrators, 
				computer programmers, and critics. We are desperate to advance discourse on access to justice beyond its current, 
				decades-old, dusty, and 
				stultefying frameworks. Got an idea for improving the calculator? A logical argument that puts it on more solid footing,
				or that addresses a challenging issue? Want to talk about implementation, governance, or other thorny issues? 
				<b>Please contact us!</b></li>
				</div>

				<h3 class = "question" id = "q_11">I've been advised by mentors and businesspeople that I should charge only one rate for everything.</h3>
				<div class = "answer" id = "ans_11" hidden><li>Well, it certainly makes things easier. And to the extent potential clients know as much, it might
				deter them from attempting to negotiate a cheaper fee.</li>
				<li>Sometimes such advice seems intended to avoid developing a <i>reputation</i> of favoratism. But of course, attorneys who
				price out substantial segments of the population from the "market" are cultivating precisely such a reputation&mdash;favoring wealthy over poorer
				people. Asserting that the attorney shouldn't address the problem with a sliding-scale fee
				is the same as arguing that those with enough money to pay "market" rates should be preferred over those that don't. (For those
				who like to think in market terms, Adam Smith's distinction
				between "natural" demand and "effectual" demand is useful here. <i>See</i> Wealth of Nations, Pp. 62ff in the 1976 Cannan edition.)</li> 
				<li>Sometimes the assertion that businesses should only market one rate is animated by a worry about the <i>legal consequences</i> of 
				price discrimination. This a meatier issue that does not seem to get the attention it deserves. "Differential pricing" is a 
				newer marketing-driven strategy for increasing sales that makes heavy use of different prices offered to differently situated
				people. And of course, dickering and negotiating prices is a deeply rooted economic practice in which different people end up 
				paying different amounts for the same good. Singling out sliding-scales based on
				economic vulnerability or a client's ability to pay	as <i>the</i> potentially problematic practice seems arbitrary.
				But the issue remains one for clear-headed discussion.</li>
				<li>Naive economic arguments citing "the public welfare" occasionally motivate complaints about 
				sliding-scale fees. At best such arguments cherry-pick from a set of complex issues associated with the legal services economy, 
				ignoring, for example, economic rents, information asymmetries, government-conferred monopolies, non-transitive preferences,
				utility functions that incorporate the public welfare, endogenous preference-formation, and other distortions in the economic 
				menagerie. Letting that slide while impeaching a <b>private-sector</b> practice that might increase the aggregate supply
				of services results in pabulum, not analysis.</li></div>

                        <h4>Business Law</h4>
                        <p>New businesses face daunting legal questions. How should the business be organized? How can it mitigate liability risks? How does taxation work? What registrations and licenses are needed? What contracts, leases, and disclosures are appropriate? Two Rivers Law is ready to help you launch your operation, from the cutting edge business to the family firm to the low-key, part-time consulting gig. We tailor our services to your budget and willingness to tackle tasks on your own, so you pay for only the assistance that you need and want.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Business Law</h5>
                        <p>Expanding a business can be challenging. Two Rivers Law can help you plan your business strategy and transactions in light of tax, intellectual property, and regulatory considerations. Whether you are hiring your first employee, bringing in new business partners, or expanding over state lines, we can help.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Mission-Driven Enterprise</h5>
                        <p>We love assisting businesses that strive to meet multiple bottom lines, such as cooperatives and other mission-driven business forms. While the possibilities for socially responsive business are exciting, the regulatory environment (including taxation, employment, financing) has not caught up. And because some laws are so new, there can be uncertainty about what they mean. Two Rivers Law can steer you through the regulations to create a stable, forward-looking, mission-driven business.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="service-two">
                        <h4>Nonprofit Law</h4>
                        <p>We absolutely love working with nonprofits, from scrappy start-ups to established, multi-faceted service organizations. We have experience with diverse nonprofits, including scientific, artistic, and educational organizations as well as those directly serving the poor or disadvantaged. Whether you need help with a fiscal sponsorship, spinning off from another nonprofit, drafting a business document, Board training, starting a new program, closing a deal, or filing a 501(c) application, we can help.</p>

                        <h5>Shoestring Budgets</h5>
                        <p>WeRunning a nonprofit can be hard work. Funds are often tight and it can be difficult to figure out where limited resources should be directed. From flat-fee billing to sliding-scale hourly rates, our financial arrangements will not break your budget. We do not oversell you on legal services. If something is straightforward for you to do, we can show you how. Often we find that a 30- or 60-minute one-on-one educational overview of a particular area of law is all that is needed. There are excellent firms that help nonprofits, and some offer reduced rates to charitable nonprofits. If your matter can be handled faster or at lower cost by another firm, we will make appropriate referrals.</p>

                        <h5>The New 1023-EZ</h5>
                        <p>In September the IRS announced a new streamlined 501(c)(3) application procedure for many small nonprofits. For example, nonprofits that expect to bring in less than $50,000 a year often qualify for this easier application. The simpler application is a wonderful development. Rather than hiring specialists to help them with the cumbersome, ordinary application, many small organizations can take on the task themselves.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="service-three">
                        <h4>Sharing Law</h4>
                        <h5>What Is the Sharing Economy?</h5>
                        <p>The term "Sharing Economy" means different things to different people. For some it means using technology ("apps") to crowdsource short-term rental arrangements. For example, many people think of using their smart phones to rent a room in someone's house, rent a car, or even "rent" a passenger seat in a car. The idea is to reduce the need to buy stuff—and so reduce overconsumption—by "sharing" stuff that people already own.</p>

                        <h5>Getting Legal Help</h5>
                        <p>Successful sharing arrangements need good planning. They can baffle regulators and fall into gray areas of the law. While running afoul of applicable rules can be disastrous, community-spirited programs also stumble over unanticipated sources of conflict—even among well-meaning and good-natured people. Two Rivers Law can help you engineer sound and peaceful solutions. Our flexible and sliding-scale billing options can put your sharing solution on a firm footing without killing your budget.</p>
